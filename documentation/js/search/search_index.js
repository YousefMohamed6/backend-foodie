Flutter app → Native Google/Apple login\n2. User authenticates → Receives signed idToken\n3. Flutter sends idToken to backend\n4. Backend verifies token with Google/Apple ✅\n5. If valid → Extract verified email → Login user\n6. If invalid → Reject with 401Documentation:\n\n📄 README_SOCIAL_LOGIN.md - Executive summary\n🔐 SOCIAL_LOGIN_SECURITY_FIX.md - Security improvements\n📱 FLUTTER_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md - Flutter setup guide\n🔧 SOCIAL_LOGIN_IMPLEMENTATION.md - Technical details\n✅ IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md - Status & checklist\n\n\n🚦 Getting Started\nPrerequisites\n\nNode.js (v18 or higher)\nPostgreSQL (v14+) with PostGIS extension\nRedis (v6+) for caching and queues\nnpm or yarn package manager\n\nInstallation\n1.
